LISTENER_PORT.  This will be the port number that the server is waiting for
connections on.

method, change the value in the quotes to the IP address of the machine that 
the you have the server running.  If you are running both programs on the 
same machine, put localhost in the quotes.

The number after the quotes should be the same port number that was in the
MudServer.java file.
